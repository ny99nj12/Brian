<h2> HTML </h2>

<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating
web pages and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
originally included cues for the appearance of the document. <br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <p style="margin-top:50px;"> With HTML constructs,
mages and other objects, such as interactive forms,
may be embedded into the rendered page.

structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
quotes and other items. </p>
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
